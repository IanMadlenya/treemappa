### treeMappa: Spatially arranged treemaps

The treeMappa software allows you to draw 2d hierarchical bar charts - treemaps - either in [Processing](http://processing.org) or as a stand-alone application. It improves on other treemap software in allowing a high degree of customisation and a variety of layouts including spatial treemaps for geospatial data.
